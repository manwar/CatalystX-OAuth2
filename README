DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the authorization grant subset of the <oauth 2
    ietf spec draft>. Action roles containing an implementation of each
    required endpoint in the specification are provided and should be
    applied to a Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole. The authorization grant
    flow is defined by the specification as follows:

      +--------+                                           +---------------+

      |        |                                           |               |
      |        |--(G)----------- Refresh Token ----------->|               |

      |        |<-(H)----------- Access Token -------------|               |
      +--------+           & Optional Refresh Token        +---------------+

    The action roles should be applied to actions in a single controller,
    and no more than one action of each role type should be present.

    Here is an overview of what roles are involved in each of those phases:

    A - Catalyst::ActionRole::OAuth2::RequestAuth
        Required

        This is the action where the authentication grant flow begins, it
        validades and sanitizes the request parameters and generates an
        authorization code which is used for issuing a valid request to the
        GrantAuth action via a redirect. The authorization code is only
        generated if all parameters are well-formed and valid, this ensures
        that requests to the GrantAuth action can trust the request
        parameters if a valid authorization code is presented.

    B - Catalyst::ActionRole::OAuth2::GrantAuth
        Required

        This action checks the request parameters for a valid authorization
        code, which should have been generated by a previous request to a
        RequestAuth action. This action should be customized to somehow
        confirm with the end-user if he wishes to effectively grant the
        authorization to the requesting client/app. The user-agent is
        redirected automatically to the correct endpoint if the
        authorization is granted.

    C and D - Catalyst::ActionRole::OAuth2::AuthToken::ViaAuthGrant
        Required

        This action exchanges a valid authorization grant code and responds
        with an authorization token.

    G and H - Catalyst::ActionRole::OAuth2::AuthToken::ViaRefreshToken
        Optional

        This action exchanges a valid refresh token for a new access token
        and refresh token.

CONFIGURATION
  store
    Takes a hashref containing two keys:

    class
        The store type to use, so far, only DBIC support is provided

    client_model
        The entity representing the client in your schema
